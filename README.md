# Tennis Predictor

A simple web application to predict the probability of winning a tennis match based on player form and surface.

## Features
- Input player names and match surface.

## How to Use
1. Open the hosted page on GitHub Pages.
2. Fill in the player names and surface.
3. Click "Predict" to view the probabilities.

## Future Plans
- Connect to a real backend for dynamic predictions.
- Use a machine learning model for more accurate results.
